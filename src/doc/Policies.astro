      <h3>Collaboration & Learning</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Copying, pasting, and reusing code is a natural and valuable part of
        learning technology and programming. Often, the best way to learn is by
        modifying existing examples, experimenting with libraries, and building
        on others’ work. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of the
        open-source philosophy: we stand on the shoulders of giants. That said,
        there are important guidelines to ensure fairness, learning, and
        academic integrity:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Following these guidelines supports your learning, respects the work of
        others, and helps maintain a fair and productive classroom environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Turn In Individual Work</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Programming is a collaborative and creative process, and you are
        encouraged to help each other learn and grow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, unless otherwise stated, all assignments and projects must
        represent your own individual work.
      </p>

      <h3>Label Borrowed Code</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Always label borrowed code. If you use code from open-source projects,
        tutorials, online forums, libraries, or AI tools. Whether you copy it
        exactly or modify it, you must clearly acknowledge your sources. When in
        doubt, include comments at the top of your code specifying where the
        original code came from and how you adapted it.
      </p>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      <h3>Understand What You Use</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        You should be able to explain how any borrowed or adapted code works,
        including AI-generated code. This helps us better assess your learning
        and ensures that you’re actively engaging with the material, not just
        copying.
      </p>

      <h3>No Full Project Copying</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Do not submit someone else’s full project as your own. Reusing snippets
        or functions is allowed with credit, but turning in entire projects
        created by others is not permitted.
      </p>
    </Card>

      <h3>Respect Licenses</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Respect licenses. When using open-source libraries or code, respect the
        terms of their licenses. Some may require attribution or have
        restrictions on commercial use.
      </p>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      <h3>AI Tools & External Resources</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        You are encouraged to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot,
        etc.) and external resources as part of your learning process. However,
        any AI-generated content included in your submission must be clearly
        disclosed and credited. You remain responsible for ensuring that the
        code works correctly and that you understand it fully.
