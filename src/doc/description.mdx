## Course Description

Students will critically analyze and explore the tools, skills, and production methods of current and emerging technologies in design media, with an emphasis on effective and appropriate creative visualization, analysis and utilization. Students will investigate technology trends within a historical context, in order to better understand and extrapolate emerging technology systems. 720A is the first semester and 720B is the second semester of this two semester studio course.

### Detailed Description

This studio aims to connect and integrate the areas of interface, interaction and experience, sequence and time, imaging, information, networks, and dynamic content. Design technology connects networks of information and people, which are transitory. This course will discuss how to cite, show, or publish work that is inherently ephemeral.

Project development is supported with ongoing studio practice, contextual design research, weekly discussions and readings, critical analysis, writing, group critiques, and meetings with faculty. Students are expected to develop innovative research on emerging technology platforms. Lectures, visiting critics and group discussions will cover historical uses of technology as well as emerging applications.

From the moment humans moved beyond utterance and gesture, technology has framed the manner in which we express ourselves and share our collective vision with the rest of our species. The definition of technology is “all things that are not human, used to transform the environment in which humans exist”. The purpose of this course is to look beyond the conventional edges of static production focused implementations of technology, and to look at technological innovation where entirely new social constructs, new devices, and new user experiences await.

Technology is traditionally associated with the tools and crafts that society has at its disposal. It is more broadly defined as the physical and ephemeral constructs employed by humanity to solve problems and achieve value. Technology can also be viewed as a collection of techniques used to fulfill human needs, or as any collection of activities that transforms and influences culture in general. In specific contexts, technology is employed (by designers) to influence and enhance ideation and conceptualization, form and experience creation, dissemination of ideas and knowledge, and interaction and feedback.

Theory-driven concepts that may be woven into the coursework include topics such as ubiquitous/ pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, activity theory as driver of human–technology relationships, embodied interaction, and mob-driven/cloud-driven design. DES 720A should be registered for in the first year, first semester of enrollment (Fall semester).

### Course Goals

- To gain a greater understanding of the historical context of technology development and its specific relevance to design and communication.
- To explore a wide range of systems to help foster creative problem-solving and ideation
- To acquire a more advanced knowledge of the design tools used for expression, collaboration and production
- To demonstrate the ability to execute sophisticated projects bridging multiple media options with professional-level workflows, formats and detail constancy
- To acquire an appreciation for the emerging concepts and language of new media
- To gain informational and aesthetic engagement with interactivity
- To understand community engagement and user experience with digital media creation

### Learning Outcomes

- Students will be able to differentiate between the different technology “periods” and speak to the positive and negative opportunities and limitations afforded by each period
- Students will be able to sketch and plan formative concepts, and migrate preliminary concepts into an agile, planned new media workflow for further exploration and refinement
- Students will be able to produce a conceptually valid cross-media design experience bridging multiple communications media formats
- Students will be able to produce industry-standard, file formats and media encodings
- Students will be able to define and design a rich media experience for a mythical or predictive array or “mashup” of communications technologies

Technology A is a community of teachers and learners and a space for experimentation. We are not here to compete, but to support each other’s learning. We recognize that everyone is moving at their own pace, on their own track of life. This is a space where we try things we’ve never done before, where we allow ourselves to be uncomfortable, and where mistakes are part of the process.

In this space:

- We learn by doing, breaking, debugging, and trying again. We encourage experimentation, risk, and growth over perfection. Progress matters more than where you started
- We ask questions early and often to help each other learn. There are no dumb questions.
- We help others when we can. This is a space where it’s okay to not know something and where asking for help is part of the process, not a weakness. We’re here to make weird things with technology, together.
- Give feedback that’s respectful, specific, and kind.
- Share what we learn. Not just our finished projects, but the messy in-progress stuff too.
- Make sure we credit and cite the people, tools and tutorials who help us get there.
- Challenge the idea that technology is neutral or universal. We ask whose stories it tells and who gets to write them.

If you believe someone is violating this Community Agreement or Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing the chair, Gaia Hwang. Sometimes, people may not realize their behavior is harmful. An open, respectful conversation can often clear things up and help everyone move forward.
