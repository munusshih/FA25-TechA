      <h3>Bulletin Description</h3>
      <p>
        Students will critically analyze and explore the tools, skills, and
        production methods of current and emerging technologies in design media,
        with an emphasis on effective and appropriate creative visualization,
        analysis, and utilization. They will investigate technology trends
        within a historical context to better understand and extrapolate
        emerging technology systems. This is a two-semester studio course: 720A
        is the first semester, and 720B is the second.

      <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
    
      <article class="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          This studio aims to connect and integrate the areas of interface,
          interaction and experience, sequence and time, imaging, information,
          networks, and dynamic content. Design technology connects networks of
          information and people, which are transitory. This course will discuss
          how to cite, show, or publish work that is inherently ephemeral.
        </p>

        <p>
          Project development is supported with ongoing studio practice,
          contextual design research, weekly discussions and readings, critical
          analysis, writing, group critiques, and meetings with faculty.
          Students are expected to develop innovative research on emerging
          technology platforms. Lectures, visiting critics and group discussions
          will cover historical uses of technology as well as emerging
          applications.
