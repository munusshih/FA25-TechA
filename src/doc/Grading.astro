        Your performance will be evaluated on its own merits, not based on
        comparing your work with other students. We focus on your understanding
        of concepts and your ability to apply them in a meaningful way. We donâ€™t
        prioritize technology efficiency or professionalism as the primary
        criteria. We value the learning process and recognize that everyone
        progresses at their own pace.

        Should you have any inquiries regarding grading, please don't hesitate
        to reach out to the faculty directly.

        Active participation is essential and comprises 25% of the final grade.
        This includes, but is not limited to: keeping up with readings,
        assignments, and projects, contributing meaningfully to class
        discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class
        regularly on time.
      </p>

      <p>
        While attendance is one aspect of active participation, absence from a
        significant portion of class can compromise successful attainment of the
        course objectives. We consider a significant portion to be three weeks
        or 20% of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be
        recorded as one full absence. We encourage you to let us know as much in
        advance as possible if you need to miss a class, are running late, or
        need to leave class early. More than three uncommunicated absences, late
        arrivals, or early departures will result in a deduction from your final
        grade.
