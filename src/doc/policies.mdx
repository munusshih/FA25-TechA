### Open Source, AI and Code Use Policy

Copying, pasting, and reusing code is a natural and valuable part of learning technology and programming. Often, the best way to learn is by modifying existing examples, experimenting with libraries, and building on others’ work. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of the open-source philosophy: we stand on the shoulders of giants. That said, there are important guidelines to ensure fairness, learning, and academic integrity:

1.  Programming is a collaborative and creative process, and you are encouraged to help each other learn and grow. However, unless otherwise stated, all assignments and projects must represent your own individual work.

2.  Always label borrowed code. If you use code from open-source projects, tutorials, online forums, libraries, or AI tools. Whether you copy it exactly or modify it, you must clearly acknowledge your sources. When in doubt, include comments at the top of your code specifying where the original code came from and how you adapted it.

3.  You should be able to explain how any borrowed or adapted code works, including AI-generated code. This helps us better assess your learning and ensures that you’re actively engaging with the material, not just copying.

4.  Do not submit someone else’s full project as your own. Reusing snippets or functions is allowed with credit, but turning in entire projects created by others is not permitted.

5.  Respect licenses. When using open-source libraries or code, respect the terms of their licenses. Some may require attribution or have restrictions on commercial use.

6.  You are encouraged to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) and external resources as part of your learning process. However, any AI-generated content included in your submission must be clearly disclosed and credited. You remain responsible for ensuring that the code works correctly and that you understand it fully.

Following these guidelines supports your learning, respects the work of others, and helps maintain a fair and productive classroom environment.
