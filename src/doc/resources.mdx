## Pratt MFA Communications Design Departmental Resources

[School of Design Labs and Studios](https://www.pratt.edu/design/homepage/school-of-design-labs-and-studios/) located in the Design Center complex in Steuben Hall and Pratt Studios. 

Equipment is available for Pratt students. Some equipment requires some training. Be on the lookout for available training sessions posted throughout the school.   

Pratt students have access to a wide range of facilities within the Department and around campus. Design School facilities include a wood shop, a metal shop, a photo studio, and there is access to computers in the studio, and in the Engineering and Machinery buildings.

### [Printing & Cutting Equipment Overview](https://one.pratt.edu/s/production) 

Saturday and Sunday: 10 AM–6 PM 

Monday–Thursday: 9 AM–10 PM 

Friday: 9 AM–5 PM 

- Laser and wide format printing (ENGR 2nd floor, Steuben 4th)

- Pratt Industrial Design Shop Facilities 

### Industrial Design Facilities 

The Industrial Design Shop provides the tools to fabricate both small-scale models or full-size prototypes  and functioning products. Wood, plastics, dense foam, and metals are among the many types of material  that can be machined or manipulated. In order to access the shop, students must register for and complete a shop certification course (IND-001). 

The course is one time only (two sessions) and the certification is good for all your time at Pratt. Beyond informing students of safety regulations, this shop course serves as an orientation to the shop, tools,  and materials. For more information, please see the Shop Orientation Manual.

### The Tool Room 

The Tool Room provides hand tools for students to check out during shop hours. The shop houses a spray booth for exclusively water-based paints and finishes. 

Several full-time staff technicians are available to help students with technical questions about materials  and fabrication techniques. 

Down-Draft Tables and several work tables for assembly and construction are available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.

### Student Access Portal onePratt 

Launchpad; Where you’ll find cloud-based software for 3D modeling/Autodesk/Adobe applications). Go to: Production Page > School of Design.

### [Print and Production Labs](https://one.pratt.edu/s/production) 

A centralized location for Pratt Institute’s Production capabilities and protocols where you’ll find digital  production tools for 2D & 3D printing, cutting, milling, and ordering materials. It includes basic machine  information, tooling options, facility locations, hours of operation, submission links, and all other pertinent  information regarding output and 

production. 

### 2D Printing Production Lab(s)

Pratt offers multiple locations for laser and wide-format inkjet printing on over 50 substrates. c/o 2D Printing Center in the Engineering Building (ENG 209 and MAC 107), Imaging Center (Steuben Hall 402), Higgins Hall (HHN 306), Pratt Manhattan 2D Printing Center (PMC 5th floor).

### 3D Printing Production Lab

Additive manufacturing utilizes a range of materials to transfer digital models into physical objects. Engineering Building: 3DPC, ENG 211. 

### Digital Cutting Production Lab

Pratt’s Zund G3XL precision machine is the largest, non-commercial, Digital Cutter in the Northeast using sophisticated cutting technology across a spectrum of drag blade and routing tools; offering tailored automation to produce jobs at the highest quality, economically and efficiently. Easy integration into digital or production workflows paired with the wide range of materials and processing methods make Zund Digital Cutting near-universally applicable providing greater latitude to project capabilities. Engineering Building: ZDC, ENG 002.
