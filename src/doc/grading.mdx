## Grading and Attendance

Your performance will be evaluated on its own merits, not based on comparing your work with other students. We focus on your understanding of concepts and your ability to apply them in a meaningful way. We don’t prioritize technology efficiency or professionalism as the primary criteria. We value the learning process and recognize that everyone progresses at their own pace.

Should you have any inquiries regarding grading, please don't hesitate to reach out to the faculty directly.

### Final Grade Calculation

| Assignment                    | Weight |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Attendance & Participation    | 25%    |
| Project 1: Flexible Manifesto | 25%    |
| Project 2: Data Sculpture     | 25%    |
| Project 3: Community Protocol | 25%    |

Active participation is essential and comprises 25% of the final grade. This includes, but is not limited to: keeping up with readings, assignments, and projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly on time.

While attendance is one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class can compromise successful attainment of the course objectives. We consider a significant portion to be three weeks or 20% of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. We encourage you to let us know as much in advance as possible if you need to miss a class, are running late, or need to leave class early. More than three uncommunicated absences, late arrivals, or early departures will result in a deduction from your final grade.

### Assignment Rubrics
