    <h2>Week 11-15: Cybernetics of Live Input</h2>
    <p>
      Building on our work with data, this unit introduces live input as
      real-time data gathered from sensors and devices to create interactive,
      responsive systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The invention of participatory systems and feedback-centered communication
      models, from early cybernetic experiments by Norbert Wiener to Douglas
      Engelbart’s vision of augmenting human intellect through collaborative
      computing, gives birth to the field of interaction design. This shift
      moves communication design beyond static, top-down messaging to dynamic,
      dialogic processes that emphasize agency, social context, and co-creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interaction design emerges as a critical practice concerned not only with
      technological innovation but with the politics of participation,
      empowerment, and how technology mediates human relationships in complex
      social systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this unit, you will learn to think in interaction and build time-based
      designs that respond to real-world inputs. You’ll investigate how embodied
      interaction challenges traditional design practices by introducing
      unpredictability, immediacy, and physical presence into both digital and
      physical forms. We’ll consider how designers can work with live,
      sensor-generated data to create responsive systems that evolve over time
      and foster connection and community through design.

    <h2>Project 3: Community Protocol</h2>
    <p>
      Design and program an interactive, time-based system that fosters ongoing
      participation from a community of your choice. Your project will establish
      a dynamic protocol—a set of rules and interactions—that shapes how the
      community engages with your design. The experience will unfold over time
      through real-time input from multiple participants or environmental
      factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the environment where your system will be situated. Whether it’s
      a public space, park, classroom, gallery, or another setting, select input
      devices (such as keyboards, mouse, camera, microphone, motion sensor,
      light, sound, or touch) that best capture meaningful interactions within
      that context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your design should respond dynamically as the community interacts,
      generating evolving visual or physical outputs that reflect the collective
      input over time. Document how the work changes throughout the day, from
      the installation’s start to its deinstallation. Considering different time
      spans and documentation intervals. Reflect on how your system fosters a
      sense of togetherness and actively encourages community participation.
