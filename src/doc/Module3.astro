      <p>
        Building on our work with data, this unit introduces live input as
        real-time data gathered from sensors and devices to create interactive,
        responsive systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The invention of participatory systems and feedback-centered
        communication models, from early cybernetic experiments by Norbert
        Wiener to Douglas Engelbart’s vision of augmenting human intellect
        through collaborative computing, gives birth to the field of interaction
        design. This shift moves communication design beyond static, top-down
        messaging to dynamic, dialogic processes that emphasize agency, social
        context, and co-creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interaction design emerges as a critical practice concerned not only
        with technological innovation but with the politics of participation,
        empowerment, and how technology mediates human relationships in complex
        social systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this unit, you will learn to think in interaction and build
        time-based designs that respond to real-world inputs. You’ll investigate
        how embodied interaction challenges traditional design practices by
        introducing unpredictability, immediacy, and physical presence into both
        digital and physical forms. We’ll consider how designers can work with
        live, sensor-generated data to create responsive systems that evolve
        over time and foster connection and community through design.

      <h2>Project 3: Community Protocol</h2>
      <Callout>
        <p>Due Sep 23.</p>
        <p>Guided by Workshop 2</p>
      </Callout>

      <p>
        Design and program an interactive, time-based system that fosters
        ongoing participation from a community of your choice. Your project will
        establish a dynamic protocol—a set of rules and interactions—that shapes
        how the community engages with your design. The experience will unfold
        over time through real-time input from multiple participants or
        environmental factors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the environment where your system will be situated. Whether
        it’s a public space, park, classroom, gallery, or another setting,
        select input devices (such as keyboards, mouse, camera, microphone,
        motion sensor, light, sound, or touch) that best capture meaningful
        interactions within that context.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your design should respond dynamically as the community interacts,
        generating evolving visual or physical outputs that reflect the
        collective input over time. Document how the work changes throughout the
        day, from the installation’s start to its deinstallation. Considering
        different time spans and documentation intervals. Reflect on how your
        system fosters a sense of togetherness and actively encourages community
        participation.
